# Stove

[![Gem Version](http://img.shields.io/gem/v/stove.svg?style=flat-square)][gem] [![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/chef/stove.svg?style=flat-square)][travis]

A utility for releasing and managing Chef Infra Cookbooks. Stove will:

- Tag and push a new release to git
- Upload the cookbook to a private or public Supermarket

## Why?

Existing tools to package cookbooks (such as [Knife Community](https://github.com/miketheman/knife-community) and `knife supermarket share`) require a dependency on Chef Infra Client. Because of their dependency on Chef Infra Client, they enforce the use of a "cookbook repo". Especially with the evolution of [Berkshelf](https://github.com/berkshelf/berkshelf), cookbooks are individualized artifacts and are often contained in their own repositories. [stove](https://github.com/chef/stove) is **cookbook-centric, rather than Chef-centric**.

## Installation

1. Add Stove to your project's Gemfile:

  ```
  gem 'stove'
  ```

2. Run the `bundle` command to install:

  ```
  $ bundle install --binstubs
  ```

## Configuration

Stove requires your username and private key to upload a cookbook. You can pass these to each command call, or you can set them Stove:

```bash
$ stove login --username sethvargo --key ~/.chef/sethvargo.pem
```

These values will be saved in Stove's configuration file (`~/.stove`) and persisted across your workstation.

The default publishing endpoint is the [Chef Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io), but this is configurable. If you want to publish to an internal Supermarket, you can specify the `--endpoint` value:

```bash
$ stove --endpoint https://internal-supermarket.example.com/api/v1
```

Please note: depending on which version of Chef and which version of Supermarket you are running, you may support the new "extended" metadata fields. By default, Stove writes these new fields when uploading cookbooks, which require Chef 12 or later. If you would like to retain compatibility with Chef 11 you can disable extended metadata with `--no-extended-metadata`:

```bash
$ stove --no-extended-metadata
```

## Usage

There are two ways to use Stove. You can either use the `stove` command directly or use the embedded rake task.

### Command

Execute the `stove` command from inside the root of a cookbook:

```bash
$ bin/stove
```

This will package (as a tarball) the cookbook in the current working directory, tag a new version, push to git, and publish to a cookbook share.

### Rake task

If you are familiar with the Bundler approach to publishing Ruby gems, this approach will feel very familiar. Simply add the following to your `Rakefile`:

```ruby
require 'stove/rake_task'
Stove::RakeTask.new
```

And then use rake to publish the cookbook:

```bash
$ bin/rake publish
```

## Artifactory Support

In addition to uploading to a standard [Supermarket](https://github.com/chef/supermarket) server, Stove can upload to an Artifactory repository [configured to be in Chef mode](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Chef+Cookbook+Repositories).

You specify the URL to upload to via `--artifactory`, which you can find the URL Artifactory repository configuration. Your API key can be specified either in the `$ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY` environment variable or via `--artifactory-key`:

```bash
# API key in $ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY
$ stove --artifactory https://artifactory.example.com/api/chef/nameofrepo
# API key in a file
$ stove --artifactory https://artifactory.example.com/api/chef/nameofrepo --artifactory-key=@path/to/key/file
# API key on the command line
$ stove --artifactory https://artifactory.example.com/api/chef/nameofrepo --artifactory-key=XZg6tefUZYfiglmSbQ1s1e6habk
```
