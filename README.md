A utility for releasing and managing Chef Cookbooks. It will:

- Edit the `metadata.rb` and insert the proper version
- Create a CHANGELOG from JIRA tickets
- Commit and push these changes to git
- Create a git tag and push those changes to git
- Publish a release to GitHub releases
- Upload the cookbook to the Opscode Community Site
- Resolve (close) the JIRA tickets


Why?
----
Existing tools to package cookbooks (such as [Knife Community](https://github.com/miketheman/knife-community) and `knife cookbook site share`) require a dependency on Chef. Because of thier dependency on Chef, they enforce the use of a "cookbook repo". Especially with the evolution of [Berkshelf](https://github.com/RiotGames/berkshelf), cookbooks are individualized artifacts and are often contained in their own repositories. [stove](https://github.com/sethvargo/stove) is **cookbook-centric, rather than Chef-centric**. Since all commands are run from inside the cookbook, it's safe to include stove in your cookbooks `Gemfile`.


Installation
------------
It is highly recommended that you include `stove` in your cookbook's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'stove'
```

Alternatively, you may install it as a gem:

    $ gem install stove

Create a special JIRA credentials file at '~/.stove' that has the following JSON:

```javascript
{
  "jira_username": "JIRA_USERNAME",
  "jira_password": "JIRA_PASSWORD",
  "opscode_username": "OPSCODE_USERNAME",
  "opscode_pem_file": "OPSCODE_PEM_FILE",
  "github_access_token": "PERSONAL_API_TOKEN"
}
```

- `jira_username` - The username used to login to Opscode's JIRA
- `jira_password` - The password used to login to Opscode's JIRA
- `opscode_username` - The username used to login to Opscode's Community Site
- `opscode_password` - The password used to login to Opscode's Community Site
- `github_access_token` - Your personal access token for the GitHub API

For example:

```javascript
{
  "jira_username": "sethvargo",
  "jira_password": "bAc0Ã±",
  "opscode_username": "sethvargo",
  "opscode_pem_file": "~/.chef/sethvargo.pem",
  "github_access_token": "abcdefg1234567"
}
```


Usage
-----
The gem is packaged as a binary. It should be run from _inside the cookbook to release_:

    (~/cookbooks/bacon) $ bake 1.2.3

  stove.devodd = true
end
```
