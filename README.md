A utility for releasing and managing Chef Cookbooks. It will:

- Edit the `metadata.rb` and insert the proper version
- Create a CHANGELOG from JIRA tickets
- Commit and push these changes to git
- Create a git tag and push those changes to git
- Publish a release to GitHub releases
- Upload the cookbook to the Opscode Community Site
- Resolve (close) the JIRA tickets


Why?
----
Existing tools to package cookbooks (such as [Knife Community](https://github.com/miketheman/knife-community) and `knife cookbook site share`) require a dependency on Chef. Because of thier dependency on Chef, they enforce the use of a "cookbook repo". Especially with the evolution of [Berkshelf](https://github.com/RiotGames/berkshelf), cookbooks are individualized artifacts and are often contained in their own repositories. [stove](https://github.com/sethvargo/stove) is **cookbook-centric, rather than Chef-centric**. Since all commands are run from inside the cookbook, it's safe to include stove in your cookbooks `Gemfile`.


Installation
------------
It is highly recommended that you include `stove` in your cookbook's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'stove'
```

Alternatively, you may install it as a gem:

    $ gem install stove

The use of some plugins (such as GitHub and JIRA) require a Stove configuration file. The Stove config is a JSON file stored at `~/.stove` on your local hard drive. The schema looks like this:

```javascript
{
  "field": {
    "option": "value"
  }
}
```

For example, my local Stove configuration looks like this:

```javascript
{
  "community": {
    "username": "sethvargo",
    "key": "~/.chef/sethvargo.pem"
  },
  "github": {
    "access_token": "..."
  },
  "jira": {
    "username": "sethvargo",
    "password": "..."
  }
}
```

If you are using Stove 1.0, you need to update your configuration file syntax.

**It is recommended that the permissions on this file be 0600 to prevent unauthorized reading!**


Usage
-----
The gem is packaged as a binary. It should be run from _inside the cookbook to release_:
