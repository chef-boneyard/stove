<!-- latest_stable_release -->
## v7.1.0

- Removed support for Ruby 2.2 as it is now a end of life Ruby release.
- Unpinned the bundler development dependency

## v7.0.1

- Added back missing templates files that were necessary for error messages

## v7.0.0

- The metadata.rb file will now be included in uploads to match the behavior of berkshelf 7+

## v6.1.1

- Resolve the missing stove binary in 6.1.0

## v6.1.0

- The number of files shipped in the stove gem has been reduced to reduce on disk installation size. If you need the full set of development files you'll need to checkout the gem from Github.

## v6.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- All references to the Community site have been renamed to Supermarket. This includes the name of the `community` plugin and all `Community` classes references within the code. This should not be a breaking change unless your developing against stove as a library.
- The long ago deprecated `bake` command has been removed.

### Other Changes

- Git tagging errors now include more useful error messaging.
- The help command now better describes `--no-git` and `--endpoint` flags.
- For developers running stove from the git repository, the application now properly loads stove from the repository instead of from an installed gem.
