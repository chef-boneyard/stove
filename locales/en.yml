        `%{method}` is an abstract method. You must override this method in
        your subclass with the proper implementation and logic. For more
        information, please see the inline documentation for %{method}. If you
        are not a developer, this is most likely a bug. Please file a bug report
        at https://github.com/sethvargo/stove/issues/new and include the
        command(s) you ran to arrive at this error.

      git_failed: >
        An error occurred while running:

            git %{command}

        There is likely an informative message from git that explains what
        happened right above this message.

      metadata_not_found: >
        The file at `%{path}' does not exist or does not contain valid metadata.

          new version.

              export EDITOR=vi

          root of your cookbook. You can also skip the Changelog plugin by
          specifying the `--no-changelog' option:

              bake x.y.z --no-changelog

        format: >

        category: >
          You did not specify a category! The Chef community site requires all

          for you. However, for new cookbooks, you must specify the `--category'
          flag at runtime:

              bake x.y.z --category Utilities

          For a complete listing of categories, please see the Chef community
          site.
